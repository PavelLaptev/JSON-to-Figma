## ✅ The correct JSON structure

The beeter JSON structure for the file should look like array of objects

```js
[
    {
        key_string: 'string #1',
        key_number: 0,
    },
    {
        key_string: 'string #2',
        key_number: 1,
    },
];

// As a result you will see buttons — `key_string`, `key_number`
```

##### ⚠️ Other JSON structures

But you also can use different JSON structures. For example:

```js
{
    "obj0": {
        "key_string": "string #1",
        "key_number": 0
    },
    "obj1": {
        "key_string": "string #2",
        "key_number": 1
    }
}

// As a result you will see buttons — `0`, `1.key_string`, `1.key_number`
```

## ⚙️ Populate Options

1. `By layer name` — You can populate layers deeply nested in any group or frame. To do so, manually rename the layer you want to populate so that it matches the name in the JSON file.
   Not a case-sensitive method — a JSON item with a `job` name will be match to `Job` layer name.

2. `Selected layers only` — Replaces text only for directly selected text layers.

3. `String templates` — Select frames or groups that contents text layers with string templates. Replaces only the contents of a string in {braces}.

4. `Random order` — All selected items will be filled in a random order. By default all your layers will be filled in order.

#### ⛔️ Restrictions

Avoid values without quotes like `null` or `undefined` your file should be an array consists of objects.
