### ‚úÖ The correct JSON structure

The beeter JSON structure for the file should look like array of objects

```js
[
    {
        key_string: 'string #1',
        key_number: 0,
    },
    {
        key_string: 'string #2',
        key_number: 1,
    },
];

// As a result you will see buttons ‚Äî `key_string`, `key_number`
```

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Other JSON structures

But you also can use different JSON structures. For example:

```js
{
    "obj0": {
        "key_string": "string #1",
        "key_number": 0
    },
    "obj1": {
        "key_string": "string #2",
        "key_number": 1
    }
}

// As a result you will see buttons ‚Äî `0`, `1.key_string`, `1.key_number`
```
